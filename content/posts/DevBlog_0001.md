## Introduction 👋
Welcome to dev-log number #0001. This blog document development progress so far, as of 06-13-2024, for project Witched Iron.

## Project Witched Iron 🦹🏽‍♀️
A little bit about Witched Iron. This is a first-person shooter being developed in Unreal Engine 5, by a single person... me! :)

Currently, targeting only PC running Linux and Windows. No multiplayer function is planed as the moment.

## Progress 📝
At the current stage, the project can be packaged in Linux and launch via Steam.

* No enemies at the presence and the level is very bare-bone with no layout.
* Gun-play is very basic, with rifle and pistol working. Additional weapons will be added soon.
* Procedural animations for aiming and shooting are working, but still need reload and switching weapon animations.
